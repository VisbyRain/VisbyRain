### Hello, Universe.  
I'm Majoring in Computer Science at WSU Pullman, and these days I'm contributing to IBM as [Qiskit Advocate](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/b7a6ac06-8256-41cc-90ed-4d53341c00c6/public_url). Also, recently I cleared the [IBM Quantum Challenge](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/fa1e1849-c349-43ce-b461-ba728d1ed3b9/public_url) held in May 2020.
